# Notebooks for the analyses in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2018.12.019

These notebooks collect code for the analyses performed in Zwaenepoel *et al.*
(2019). Furthermore, our response to the original reply of Wang *et al.* to our
manuscript is included (`reply_wang_original.pdf`). Note that the final
(published) reply of Wang *et al.* (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2018.12.020)
does not include the same figures as the original one, to which is referred in
this response. However our arguments concerning isoform filtering and why our
original concerns were not addressed in this original response are equally
relevant to the published response by Wang *et al.*

**Contents:**

- `dlsim.ipynb`: code for a stochastic simulation of the birth-death model
of duplicate gene demography of Lynch & Conery (2000).
- `ks_modeling.ipynb`: code for plotting and computing histograms, KDEs 
and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) for *K*<sub>S</sub> distributions
- `reply_wang_original.pdf`: our (unmodified) reply to the original 
response by Wang *et al.*
