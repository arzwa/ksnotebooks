# Notebooks for the analyses in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2018.12.019

These notebooks collect code for the analyses performed in Zwaenepoel *et al.*
(2019). Furthermore, our response to the original reply of Wang *et al.* to our
manuscript is included (`reply_wang_original.pdf`). Note that the final
(published) reply of Wang *et al.* (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molp.2018.12.020)
does not include the same figures as the original one, to which is referred in
this response. However our arguments concerning isoform filtering and why our
original concerns were not addressed in this original response are equally
relevant to the published response by Wang *et al.*
